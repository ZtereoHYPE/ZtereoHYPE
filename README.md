## Hello, my name is ZtereoHYPE.

I'm a Java/JS developer looking into exploring and understanding other branches of computing science.

Minecraft (popular 2011 videogame) is cool.

The main things I wanna explore right now are rendering and low-level computing, so keep an eye out for potential projects in that area :)
